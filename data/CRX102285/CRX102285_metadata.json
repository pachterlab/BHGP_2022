        "description": "Analysis of gene expression in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with flagellated or aflagellated S. enteritidis or recombinant flagellin. Results provide insight into how flagellin mediates innate immune responses in intestinal epithelial cells. Keywords: Gene expression analysis Overall design: Caco-2 cells were grown in 100 mm dishes to 3 days post-confluence. Cells were then incubated for 2 h with the following four treatments: medium alone (control); flagellated S. enteritidis; aflagellated S. enteritidis; or recombinant flagellin. Three independent experiments were performed to give an N=3 for each treatment. Caco-2 RNA was extracted and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.",
